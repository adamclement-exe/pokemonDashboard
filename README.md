T Level Technical Qualification (Level 3) in Digital: Digital Production, Design and Development.

Selection, Production & Review Assessment
 
Set Task Brief
You are employed by Exe-Games as a Junior Software Developer.
Exe-Games have been asked by Nintendo of America to produce a solution that provides the following:

•	A basic GUI to access the solution

•	A data dashboard showing all the Pokemon in the provided CSV file.  The dashboard should look professional and only show the following information for each Pokemon:
o	Name
o	Type 1	
o	Type 2 (if not null)
o	Generation

•	A method of filtering the data on the dashboard to show only:
o	Pokemon of a specific type (e.g. Fire, Water, Poison, etc.)
o	Pokemon with certain characters in their name (e.g. ‘Mag’ would show Magnemite, Magneton, Magmar, etc)
o	Legendary Pokemon

•	A method of adding and updating the data file, allowing for changes to be made to existing Pokemon data as well as Generation 7 Pokemon to be added. (You do not need to add these Pokemon, just provide a method for doing so).


 
Activity
Developing the solution
Develop a functional solution to meet the client’s needs.
During development, make sure you:
•	implement secure code, committing changes to GIT each session, to develop a solution for the client
•	make use of, and document, iterative testing
•	document the iterative development process, including changes made to the solution during development using GIT
•	produce code that can be maintained by a third party 
•	further develop code that has been written by someone else in the group
•	ensure a high-quality user experience

Your testing documentation does not need to include details of every test carried out.
However, it should demonstrate:
•	an iterative approach to testing
•	understanding of how to test inputs and processes using appropriate test data. 
The GIT Repo:
https://github.com/adamclement-exe/pokemonDashboard
The csv file you will be using has been added to the repo already.
You should have received an invite to gain access to the repo – if not, email adamclement@exe-coll.ac.uk to request access.

Documenting the solution
The iterative development of the solution will be documented using the comments on commits as well as the comments in the code.  You will also need to produce a User Manual, for non-technical users, explaining all the functionality of the solution.  


Evaluating the solution
Produce an evaluation of the effectiveness of the prototype digital solution you have developed.
Your evaluation should consider:
•	the effectiveness of the assets and content used, including:
o	why the chosen assets and content were selected, and why other content was rejected
o	the validity and reliability of the sources of information used
o	any legal and ethical implications of the assets and content selected
•	how well the digital solution you planned and produced meets:
o	functional and non-functional requirements of the solution
o	key performance indicators (KPIs)
o	user acceptance criteria for the proposed solution
•	how the prototype could be developed further.
 
Outcomes for Submission

The solution
The finished solution will be hosted on GIT at https://github.com/adamclement-exe/pokemonDashboard
The contributions you make will be automatically time-stamped and logged.
Use any sensible folder structure and naming convention.
The solution will need a user manual, for non-technical people to understand how to use the solution.  This will be written individually and submitted via. Moodle. https://moodle.exe-coll.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=107891


Development documentation
All design and testing documentation should be uploaded to the GIT repo.
You should document the development of the solution by commenting your code and commits.
You need to evaluate your own performance as well as how well the solution meets the client’s needs.  This evaluation will be submitted via. Moodle. https://moodle.exe-coll.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=107889
