//-----------------------------MENU-----------------------------\\
When starting the program for the first time you'll be greeted with
great music playing and three buttons to choose from and a menu bar
which has the music settings. Let's explore these three buttons and
the menu bar and what they do.

- Start: The start button allows you to continue on with the program
and makes you go to the launch menu, but we will cover the launch me-
nu after the menu section.

- Devs: The devs button shows you all the people which contributed
and all the developers who made it possible to make the program.

- Settings: The settings button takes you to the settings window
where you're able to see all the settings, but we will also visit
the settings page later.

- Music Menu Bar: At the top left of the window there is a tab
called Music, when you click on it and a menu bar will also
pop up with another two options, the first option is,
'----' this allows you to move the menu bar dynamically and
under it there is 'Music Settings', when this is clicked it
will show a messagebox which shows all of the commands for
the music controls. The music controls are as followed:
Ctrl+P = pauses the music, Ctrl+U = unpauses the music,
Ctrl+S = Stops the current completely and lastly
Ctrl+Right = Skips a song randomly.
