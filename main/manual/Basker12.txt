Basker's Manual

When booting up the program for the first time you'll have three buttons to choose from, these include: Start, Devs and Settings.
Each button does something different, the Devs button shows you all the devs that contributed and created the program, settings button
takes you to the settings page where you can change some stuff like the font, but we will revisit the settings page later on.
