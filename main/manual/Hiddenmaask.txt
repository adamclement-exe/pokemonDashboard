There are 3 main buttons on dashboard, these can be used by clicking on them.

Previous - This button is available to press after the second card being displayed. This allows you to view the previous
           card without losing any data or overlapping text. This means you can compare cards together, for example
           without the hassle of backing out and searching up the pokemon again and having to remember any values.

Home     - This button is available on mostly all of the windows on the program and pressing it returns you to the
           window you see at the very start when you load the program. This just makes it so users don't have to reload
           the code to access certain areas, allowing a continued use of the program.

Next     - When displaying more that one Pokémon the Next button will be selectable. This allows you to scroll through
	       all Pokémon or any Pokemon which fit the filter requirements. This can be followed up by pressing the
	       previous button to go one by one through all the different Pokémon.

Multiple stats are displayed on the Pokémon card, these mean as follows:

Gen: []  - This is the first generation the Pokémon displayed appeared in, a generation of Pokémon is usually when
           around about 100 Pokémon are released in a batch at the same time, appearing in a new Pokémon video game
	       and the Pokémon cards.
	   
Atk: []  - The Attack stat, or informally Physical Attack, partly determines how much damage a Pokémon deals when using
           a physical move. A physical move is one of the three categories of moves and one of the two that inflict
           damage.

Def: []  - Defense determines how much damage a Pokémon will resist when hit by a physical move. The average base
           Defense for a Pokémon is 70, while the average base Defense for a fully evolved Pokémon is 83.

HP:  []  - HP, which is short for Hit Points, is a value that determines how much damage a Pokémon can receive. When a
           Pokémon's HP is completely down to 0, the Pokémon will faint. HP is the most frequently affected stat of them
           +all, as depleting HP is the key factor in winning a battle.
