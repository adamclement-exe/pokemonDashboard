Hiddenmaask's Manual

There are 3 main buttons on dashboard.

Previous - This button is available to press after the second card being displayed. This allows you to view the previous
           card without losing any data or overlapping text. This means you can compare cards together, for example,
           without the hassle of backing out and searching up the pokemon again and having to remember any values.

Home - This button is available on mostly all of the windows on the program
