Hiddenmaask's Manual

There are 3 main buttons on dashboard, these can be used by clicking on them.

Previous - This button is available to press after the second card being displayed. This allows you to view the previous
           card without losing any data or overlapping text. This means you can compare cards together, for example
           without the hassle of backing out and searching up the pokemon again and having to remember any values.

Home     - This button is available on mostly all of the windows on the program and pressing it returns you to the
           window you see at the very start when you load the program. This just makes it so users don't have to reload
           the code to access certain areas, allowing a continued use of the program.

Next     - When displaying more that one Pokemon the Next button will be selectable. This allows you to scroll through
	   all Pokemon or any Pokemon which fit the filter requirements. This can be followed up by pressing the
	   previous button to go one by one through all the different Pokemon.

Multiple stats are displayed on the Pokemon card,
